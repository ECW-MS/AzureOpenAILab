# Task 01 - Install client tools (20 minutes)

## Introduction

There are several client tools that you will use throughout this lab. These are standard tools for teams working with AI services from both Microsoft and other companies. The first task in this exercise is to prepare a machine--whether a virtual machine or your local computer--to perform these exercises.

## Description

In this task, you will ensure that you have a particular set of tools installed on your own computer.

{: .note }
> You may also choose to use a [Dev Container](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers) for this training. The Dev Container has Python, .NET, and the Azure CLI pre-installed.

The key tasks are as follows:

1. Ensure that you have the following software installed:
   1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) and [Bicep](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep) extensions for Visual Studio Code. Alternatively, if you have Visual Studio installed, you can use that.
   2. [A Git client](https://git-scm.com/download/). An alternative option is to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
   3. [Python 3.10 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend you install the [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://anaconda.com/download), though you can use a standard installation of Python. In the exercises, you may need to install additional packages.

      {: .note }
      > If you do not use the Anaconda distribution of Python, make sure that you can run `python` and `pip` from your command line. If you are not sure whether you have pip installed, run `python -m ensurepip` to check.

2. Clone [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Implementing-automation-practices-using-Azure-OpenAI) to your local machine.

## Success Criteria

- You have installed all necessary tools.
- You have cloned the GitHub repository to your local machine or virtual machine.

## Learning Resources

- Cloning a repository via the [command line](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)
